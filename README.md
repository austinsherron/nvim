# Neovim

I'm a longtime vim user, recent nvim convert. I'm having a lot of fun (and probably spending too much time ðŸ˜…) diving into the ecosystem and crafting
my setup. My goal is to move from IntelliJ to an nvim based, "home-baked" IDE. My current big ticket items are:

- [x] Trying to find a file browser that feels right, or that I can hack easily enough to feel natural
- [x] Getting the bare bones pickers there and natural feeling
- [ ] Setting up LSP related functionality, including: auto-completion, assisted refactoring, various "jump-to"/find commands, etc.
- [x] Tightening up git integration; I've installed [diffview.nvim](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim) and [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim), but I need to further configure them. [Neogit](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit) seems promising, for filling in some functional gaps, so I think I'll install that next (ended up installing all of these, but am most happy w/ [lazygit.nvim](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim), highly recommended!)
- [ ] Installing and incorporating into my workflows one of the many snippets engines out there. I haven't made much use of snippets in the past, so this will be something a bit new for me.

There are definitely more, but this README, like my nvim journey in general, is a work in progress!

## Plugin Organization

I organize my plugins into the following categories:

* **Appearance** - Appearance plugins control how nvim looks: colors, icons, textures, menus, etc. These are distinct from interface plugins in that interface elements should be functional (and ideally useful). Appearance is the place for things that provide aesthetic value only.
* **Code** - Code plugins control nvim's ability to understand, generate, and generally interact w/ code.
* **Editor** - Editor plugins control core editor capabilities like commenting, completion, general text manipulation, etc.
* **Git** - Git plugins enable nvim + git interactions/integrations.
* **Interface** - Interface plugins add to, control, or augment interface elements. Interface elements should *do something*, or at least be informational, as opposed to being purely aesthetic.
* **Motion** - Motion plugins control on-screen (as opposed to file-system) movement.
* **Navigation** - Navigation plugins control (file) system (as opposed to on-screen) movement.
* **Search** - Search plugins make it easier to find things.
* **Test** - Test plugins enable unit testing and related functionality.
* **Tools** - Tools plugins add misc functionality to nvim; they add *explicitly new* functionality to nvim, as opposed to changing something about the way its core functions work. Tools here don't fit into any other categories.
* **Workspace** - Workspace plugins control capabilities related to managing and manipulating "workspace" elements. These include buffers, tabs, windows, sessions, projects, and groupings/filtered views of the same.
