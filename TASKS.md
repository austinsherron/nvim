## Tasks

- [ ] I'm not totally happy w/ my tab/buffer management schemes and my non-workflows that haven't really come to be w/ my current tooling
- [ ] Incorporate tabs (and windows?) into workflows (not very concrete)
- [ ] How can I open multiple files at once w/ nvimtree?
- [ ] Change diff/merge view colors to something that makes for better UX
- [ ] Remap available spectre commands: https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre
- [ ] Add (relative) line numbers by default to diffview, undotree, spectre, etc.
- [ ] Create lualine extensions for diffview, undotree, and spectre
- [ ] Add ability to refactor imports on file move
- [ ] Leap "repeat"/"again" capability, like "n"/"N" in search?
- [ ] Git interactions from nvimtree (partially there w/ stage/unstage)
- [ ] Add LuaSnip custom snippets
- [ ] Enhance styling (i.e.: selective bolding, diff fonts, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor nvim utils to separate repo? (at least those that would be/are useful for plugins as well)
- [ ] Use lsp hooks to plug into lsp, instead of baking dependent code directly into lsp setup
- [ ] Continue comments only in docstrings
- [ ] Automatically add new params to docstrings
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add Lualine support for projects
- [ ] Add Lualine support for sessions
- [ ] Add more systematic logging
- [ ] Add more systematic error-handling
- [ ] Spectre in a modal?
- [ ] Change diagnostic symbols to something snazzier
- [ ] Add tracebacks to error logging
- [ ] Add ability to make file executable from nvim-tree
- [ ] Configure auto-completion support for neorepl
- [ ] Add barbar + session integration so buffers are restored in correct order

### Completed

- [x] Make gitsigns symbols more obvious (seems to be based on the colorscheme, but enabling numhl seems to have helped)
- [x] Add ability to optionally suppress notifications when logging w/ nvim logger
- [x] Add ability to parameterize persistence of notifications logged through nvim logger
- [x] Add augroup's to autocmds
- [x] Add leap highlight (more "won't do", as I've adopted folke's "flash.nvim" as my motion plugin of choice)
- [x] Bi-directional leap
- [x] Leap in nvimtree
- [x] Telescope picker for package dir (i.e.: plugins)
- [x] Homegrown session manager (got most [much?] of the way there and then figured out how to make session manager plugin do what I want it to [i.e.: session per dir, more or less])
- [x] Customize titles in contextual telescope extension search
- [x] Better nvim init error handling (unclear if it actually works, but it's there-ish)
- [x] Notifications/modals/confirmation menus on nvim init error
- [x] Logger should write to nvim application logs
- [x] Update nvim alias to include writing to logs (didn't do exactly this, but logs are being written and it's as configurable as it needs to be at this point)
- [x] Refactor KeyMapper to use state so as to avoid duplication "options" functions, etc.
- [x] Enable spell-checker/grammar helper/etc. (potentially investigate spellchecker plugins, i.e.: spelunker)
- [x] Enable minor auto-reformatting, i.e.: aligning spacing, remove trailing whitespace, automatic newlines + alignment, replacing tabs w/ spaces, etc. (editorconfig got me a lot of the way there, but I can still do better -> neoformat)
- [x] Add ability to close all buffers except "this one" (i.e.: the focused buffer)
- [x] Add ability to copy file contents from nvim-tree
- [x] Copy file content to clipboard from nvimtree (dup)

## Fixes

- [ ] Check for nvim-surround treesitter dependency; if it has one, add it to TreesitterPlugin and make downstream changes
- [ ] Fix issues w/ session mgr not restoring sessions from cwd even though I'm now manually setting it
- [ ] Issue upgrading LuaSnip
- [ ] Figure out auto-session <-> lualine integration issues, i.e.: can't import auto-session.lib (or auto-session at all, really)
- [ ] Figure out cyclic import issue w/ logging
- [ ] Figure out why barbar diagnostics don't work
- [ ] Fix aerial markdown issue
- [ ] Figure out why restoring sessions often causes barbar errors
- [ ] "Fix plugins extension" (?)
- [ ] Disable cmdline auto-completion for specific commands (ls, for example)
- [ ] Barbar shouldn't reopen non-editable/help buffers (i.e.: nvimtree, diffview, side panel, etc.)
- [ ] Bufresize should ignore certain window types (i.e.: nvimtree, diffview, side panel, etc.)
- [ ] Figure out why neorepl doesn't always seem to have the latest version of code, even when I stop/start nvim (maybe due to my "on_bind" global imports...?)
- [ ] Fix indent-blankline
- [ ] Fix snippet loading

### Completed

- [x] !!! Diagnose and fix Treesitter issues (see fb465783acaa09ac0f8c1ab07eac6e22948f8ea3 for resolution notes)
- [x] Figure out why tabs.lua isn't being read from keymap/, then move from keymap/plugins -> keymap/ (ended up being an issues w/ the way "require paths" were being constructed for recursive calls)
- [x] Fix lua_ls workspace configuration prompt
- [x] Fix leap.nvim repeat functionality (didn't really fix this, but have opted, at least for the moment, to use flash.nvim, instead of leap, as my primary motion plugin)
- [x] DiffviewClose doesn't consistently close all diffview buffers/windows (the issue ended up being a usability problem really: it's possible for multiple diffview menus to open, and it's not always obvious what's happening when sequentially closing them)
- [x] Auto-session has issues saving/restoring "special" (maybe literally?) buffers, i.e.: nvim-tree, undotree (presumably), diffview, etc.... (ended up sticking w/ existing session manager plugin)
- [x] Re-install, or otherwise just fix, nvim-tmux-navigation
- [x] Fix buffer ordering (or fix sequential navigation, i.e.: navigate in visual order)
- [x] Fix "redo" custom mapping repeatability, i.e.: I can't hit leader (`<space>`) once and hit `r` N times to get N redo operations (got rid of mapping altogether)
- [x] Fix "redo" custom mapping wait time
- [x] Migrate nvimtree `view.mappings` to `on_attach`
- [x] nvimtree won't toggle hidden files (can't ever see/interact w/ them)
- [x] Nvim is complaining that the Lua LSP isn't installed (used mason to install)
- [x] Something seems to be wrong w/ treesitter plugin setup (opts is nil?) (I think this has been addressed; will know when next update is pushed)
- [x] Fix gitsigns on_attach (doesn't seem to be getting bound/called)
- [x] Add more words/better dictionaries ("suggest word(s)" action never actually suggests anything) (ended up being a misconfiguration: spell suggest setting shouldn't have been an int)
- [x] Update lua files/packages that export functions to encapsulate them in tables
- [x] Figure out why, even after changing the supposedly relevant vim configs., adding a new line from a comment, above or below the commented line, continues the comment

## Ideas

### Refactor:

- [ ] Change parameter position, or otherwise change parameters
    - [ ] Update docs
    - [ ] Update call sites
- [ ] Make function, method, field, etc public/private/package/protected
- [ ] Easily wrap values in function calls/or arbitrary braces
- [ ] Easily move functions/methods w/in a file
- [ ] Moving files w/ path dependent imports changes imports
- [ ] Change case style (i.e.: CamelCaseEr, snake_case_er, Title-Er, UPPERER, lowerer, etc.er)
- [ ] Auto-fill completed function params
- [ ] Deleting a control structure and automatically reindenting interior code

### File Create Sub-Menu:

Menu in file-explorer (i.e.: nvim-tree) that allows you to choose specific kinds of files/dirs to create. Can include custom types as well as templates. Some examples:

- [ ] New lang specific file
  - [ ] lua
  - [ ] python
  - [ ] shell (i.e. bash)
- [ ] New lang specific folder structure
  - [ ] Python project (i.e. w/ project.toml)
  - [ ] Python module (ie.e. w/ __init__.py)
- [ ] Create missing function/method/var, etc.
