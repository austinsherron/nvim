# Neovim

I'm a longtime vim user, recent nvim convert. I'm having a lot of fun (and probably spending too much time 😅) diving into the ecosystem and crafting
my setup. My goal is to move from IntelliJ to an nvim based, "homebaked" IDE. My current big ticket items are:

* Trying to find a file browser that feels right, or that I can hack easily enough to feel natural
  * Still on nvim-tree after trying out nnn and not really digging it
  * neo-tree seems promising, I just haven't gotten there yet
* Getting the bare bones pickers there and natural feeling

There are definitely more, but this README, like my nvim journey in general, is a work in progress!

## To-Do Lists

### Plugins/Tooling

- [ ] Auto-completion/correction
- [ ] Auto-imports
- [ ] Code generations (see snippets)
- [ ] Code searching utility
- [x] Colorscheme (but always evolving)
- [x] Comments
- [ ] Debugger
- [x] Diff viewer (could be better though...)
- [x] Filetree/explorer (not 100% happy, need to look into neo-tree, etc.)
- [ ] Find+Replace
- [ ] Formatting
- [ ] General prettiness (😅)
- [x] Git in-file indicators (again, not 100% happy, want to continue exploring)
- [ ] Git interactions
- [ ] Git sidebar changes
- [ ] Inline docs/hints
- [ ] Merge tool
- [ ] Notifications
- [x] Persistent undo history
- [x] Project manager (still wanna see what other options are out there though)
- [ ] Renaming/refactoring
- [ ] Session manager
- [ ] Snippets
- [x] Start screen? (again, wanna explore)
- [x] Status bar (would like to customize it more though)
- [x] Surround
- [ ] Syntax checking
- [x] Tab/buffer bar
- [x] Telescope
- [x] Undo tree (it works, but could look better... I dunno, wanna continue looking/tinkering)

### Tasks/Fixes

- [ ] Re-install, or otherwise just fix, nvim-tmux-navigation
- [ ] Enable spell-checker/grammar helper/etc.
- [ ] Enable minor auto-reformatting, i.e.: aligning spacing, remove trailing
      whitespace, automatic newlines + alignment, replacing tabs w/ spaces, etc.
- [ ] I'm not totally happy w/ my tab/buffer management schemes and my
      non-workflows that haven't really come to be w/ my current tooling (i.e.:
      it'd be nice to have some visual labels of which buffer is which, and a
      quick way to jump to that buffer
- [ ] Fix buffer ordering
- [ ] Fix "redo" custom mapping repeatability, i.e.: I can't hit leader
      (`<space>`) once and hit `r` N times to get N redo operations
