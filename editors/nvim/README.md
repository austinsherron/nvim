# Neovim

I'm a longtime vim user, recent nvim convert. I'm having a lot of fun (and probably spending too much time ðŸ˜…) diving into the ecosystem and crafting
my setup. My goal is to move from IntelliJ to an nvim based, "homebaked" IDE. My current big ticket items are:

* Trying to find a file browser that feels right, or that I can hack easily enough to feel natural
  * Still on nvim-tree after trying out nnn and not really digging it
  * neo-tree seems promising, I just haven't gotten there yet
* Getting the bare bones pickers there and natural feeling

There are definitely more, but this README, like my nvim journey in general, is a work in progress!
